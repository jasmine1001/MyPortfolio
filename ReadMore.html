        <h3>A new feature Known as Split Payments, is set to launch for U.S. users next week.</h3>
<h2>It was always a difficult task to split bills among friends or when go out partying.Facebook is up with this new feature in messenger called split payments.</h2>
<p>
    
    <p>An easy and fast way to share the costs of bills and expenses.</p>
    <p> The feature works as follows : In a group chat, you'll need to hit the "Get Started" button to initiate the payments, and then you can choose to divide a sum of money evenly or decide what each person owes. You can also choose to include yourself and add a customizable message. The money will be sent through Facebook Pay, and after you submit, your request will be sent to the group's chat room.Along with it users can also ask money from the people right in the group chat itself and can also check if their friend/roomate has paid the money or not or they can send  a reminder if not.
     Facebook also added one more feature which will contain some group effects to have some augmented reality features . It also added up a feature to some new Taylor Swift and Stranger Things "soundmojis": short sound clips that can be sent like a regular emoji.</p>
    <p>The company is willing to bring up more new features so as to bring new custom Group Effects, available on Messenger and Instagram video calls.

        Facebook also launched a new chat theme and soundmojis earlier this month to help you express your fandom and have some fun video calling friends or relatives on messenger app.
    For now this feature is availabe only for U.S users but soon other user will also be able to use it.
