<h4>An event is an important part of JavaScript. With the help of events a web page responds accordingly.</h4>
<p>
    Some events are user generated and some are generated by API’s. An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur. The simple example of an event is a user clicking the mouse.

The addEventListener() is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for, and a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets fired. Any number of event handlers can be added to a single element without overwriting existing event handlers. It does not override the existing event handlers. Events are said to be an essential part of the JavaScript. A web page responds according to the event that occurred.
 
<h3>We use it by following this syntax:</h3>
<h4>element.addEventListener(event, listener, useCapture);</h4>
<p>
    following are the parameters:
 

<p>event : event can be any valid JavaScript event.Events are used without “on” prefix like use “click” instead of “onclick” or “mousedown” instead of “onmousedown”.</p>

<p>
    listener(handler function) : It can be a JavaScript function which respond to the event occur.
</p>

<p>
    useCapture: It is an optional parameter used to control event propagation. A boolean value is passed where “true” denotes capturing phase and “false” denotes the bubbling phase.
