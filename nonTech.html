<h2>Indian Women Suits for Every Occasion </h2>
<h3>Daytime Festivities</h3>
<p> 
The Indian festive season is approaching, and you must decide on what to wear to each festival beforehand. One can never have enough festive wear in your closet. This peach-coloured suit set could be your choice to wear on any day during the Ganpati Utsav. You can also consider wearing this to a daytime wedding function too!
</p>
<h3>Summer weddings</h3>
<p>
    Weddings are an integral part of Indian culture. An Indian wardrobe is incomplete, with one or two shelves full of women suits suitable for weddings and related ceremonies. The best part is you can also repurpose those clothes at festivals. Weddings in summers are too hard to decide on what to wear. Indian summers are cruel; you will be sweaty and messy right after arriving at the venue. So, I would prefer to wear something comfortable and practical for humid days. </p>

    <h3>
        Go Minimal Chic at a Coctail party
    </h3>
    <p>Cocktail parties are generally held in the evening, and most people prefer wearing western semi-formals. But what if you step in wearing a stunning blue chikankari suit set? You’ll bring in some fresh air to the party, and I can assure you each pair will be on you. </p>
    <p>This is one of my favourite women suits, and thus it is today’s showstopper. This sleeveless chikankari suit set has a flared hemline and high side slits, making it extremely chic, modern, and classy. The powder blue colour is so unique to be a party colour, thus making you stand out in the crowd. There is chikankari work going on all over the front and back portion of the kameez while the dupatta and salwar pants are plain with some lacework in the hemline of the dupatta. 

        The only thing you have to keep in mind is how you are styling a chikankari outfit. You can pair it up with dainty silver jewellery to match the overall look of the outfit. 
        
        So, this was my list of five occasions we find very hard to decide on ethnic wear. Indian suit sets are undoubtedly the most versatile yet the most underrated clothing ever, and we should consider wearing more of those to different occasions. With the right accessories and unique styling, Indian ethnic wear is undeniably unmatched. </p>

        <h3>Fun, Fierce, and Fabulous Fashion</h3>
        <p>
            Covering up should not need to mean that you also hide your individuality. You have choices in avant-modest fashions that can be seen in Afro-retro styles, tribal clothing, and other distinctively original designs that take your preferences for modesty in mind. From stylish seqs to beautiful bishts, there is a long list of options that you can wear.
            
            Showing your fun, fierce, and fabulous side does not mean revealing a whole swathe of skin. Sometimes, it takes creative imagination and a healthy dose of confidence to sashay down the streets in modest yet magnificent style.
